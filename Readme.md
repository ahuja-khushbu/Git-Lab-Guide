### What is Git? 📚✨

Imagine you’re writing a story, and you want to keep track of all the cool changes you make. Git is like a magic notebook 📓 that remembers every version of your story, so you never lose your ideas! It tells you who wrote what and helps you fix mistakes if you need to. 🪄
Git is an open source free version control system that helps to track and manage changes in our code.For example the git command is " git config --global user.name "Your name"" this will initialize your name whenever you will try to modify the content into the files which are reposited on the git. 
The two main features of Git are
- free and open source -Git is released under the GNU General Public License version 2.0, which is an open source license. The Git project chose to use GPLv2 to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-Version Control System (VCS) -"And here the version control means tracking the changes and managing the software codes, files and assets. and the system doing the process is known as VCS"
