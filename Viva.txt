#viva questions
Here are the answers to the viva questions from basic to advanced:

### **Basic Questions:**

1. **What is Git, and how does it differ from other version control systems like SVN?**
   - Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project. Unlike SVN (a centralized VCS), Git allows each user to have a full local copy of the repository and commit changes independently, which enhances collaboration and redundancy.

2. **What is a repository in Git? How do you create one?**
   - A repository is a directory where your project's files are stored along with their version history. You can create a repository using `git init` (for an existing directory) or `git clone <repo_url>` (to copy a remote repository).

3. **Explain the purpose of the `git init` command.**
   - The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a `.git` folder where Git will store all version history.

4. **What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?**
   - `git add` stages changes (adds them to the staging area), while `git commit` records the staged changes as a new snapshot in the project’s version history.

5. **How can you check the status of your working directory in Git?**
   - You can use `git status` to see which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked in your working directory.

6. **What is a commit in Git, and why is it important?**
   - A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a particular point in time. Commits allow you to track changes, revert to earlier versions, and collaborate with others.

7. **What is a branch in Git? How do you create and switch branches?**
   - A branch is an independent line of development. You can create a new branch with `git branch <branch_name>` and switch to it using `git checkout <branch_name>` or `git switch <branch_name>`.

8. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**
   - `git fetch` retrieves the latest changes from the remote but doesn’t merge them into your working directory, while `git pull` fetches the changes and merges them into your current branch.

9. **What is the purpose of `.gitignore`, and how does it work?**
   - `.gitignore` is a file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore and not track. This is useful for files that are generated by the system or are too large to store (e.g., log files, build artifacts).

10. **How can you view the commit history in Git?**
   - You can view the commit history using `git log`, which shows a list of commits, their messages, and details about the author and time.

### **Intermediate Questions:**

1. **Explain the concept of staging in Git. What is the difference between the working directory, staging area, and repository?**
   - The working directory contains your files. The staging area is a place where you can group changes before committing them. The repository stores your project's history. You move changes from the working directory to the staging area with `git add` and from the staging area to the repository with `git commit`.

2. **What is a merge conflict, and how do you resolve it?**
   - A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes between branches because the same file or lines were modified in conflicting ways. You resolve it by manually editing the conflicting files and then marking the conflict as resolved with `git add <file>`.

3. **What does the `git stash` command do? When would you use it?**
   - `git stash` temporarily saves your local changes without committing them so that you can work on something else (e.g., switch branches). You can later retrieve the changes with `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`.

4. **How can you reset a file or a commit in Git? What is the difference between `git reset --soft` and `git reset --hard`?**
   - `git reset` moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit. `git reset --soft` keeps the changes in the working directory and staging area, while `git reset --hard` discards all changes in both.

5. **What is fast-forward merging, and how is it different from a true merge?**
   - Fast-forward merging occurs when the branch being merged has no additional commits of its own; Git simply moves the pointer forward to the new commit. In contrast, a true merge creates a new commit that combines changes from both branches.

6. **Explain what is meant by ‘detached HEAD’ in Git and how to fix it.**
   - A detached HEAD state occurs when you check out a commit directly instead of a branch. To fix it, you can create a new branch from that state using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.

7. **What is rebase in Git, and how is it different from merging?**
   - `git rebase` moves or applies your branch’s commits on top of another base branch. It rewrites the commit history, unlike `git merge`, which creates a new merge commit to integrate changes.

8. **How do you handle a situation where the remote repository has new changes that conflict with your local changes?**
   - You can run `git pull`, resolve any conflicts manually, and then commit the changes. Alternatively, you can use `git fetch` followed by `git rebase` to apply your changes on top of the latest changes from the remote.

9. **Explain the purpose of `git cherry-pick`. When would you use it?**
   - `git cherry-pick` allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It is useful when you need to backport changes to an older branch or apply a fix from a feature branch to the main branch.

10. **How can you revert a specific commit that has already been pushed to the remote?**
    - You can use `git revert <commit_hash>`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the original commit, without modifying the commit history.

### **Advanced Questions:**

1. **What is the difference between `git rebase` and `git merge`, and when would you prefer one over the other?**
   - `git rebase` rewrites the commit history by moving your changes on top of another branch, while `git merge` integrates changes with a new merge commit. Rebase is preferred for a clean, linear history, while merging is better when preserving the context of when branches diverged.

2. **What is Gitflow, and how does it help in managing software development workflows?**
   - Gitflow is a branching model that defines a strict branching strategy for managing feature development, releases, and hotfixes. It helps teams collaborate effectively by ensuring a clear structure for integrating features and fixing bugs.

3. **Explain how `git bisect` helps in debugging.**
   - `git bisect` performs a binary search through your commit history to find the commit that introduced a bug. You mark commits as good or bad, and Git narrows down the problematic commit.

4. **How do you optimize a repository's size using Git’s garbage collection and cleaning features (`git gc`)?**
   - `git gc` cleans up unnecessary files and optimizes the local repository by compressing objects. This helps reduce repository size and improves performance.

5. **What are Git hooks, and how can you implement them in a project?**
   - Git hooks are scripts that run automatically in response to certain Git events (e.g., before committing, after pushing). You can implement them by placing executable scripts in the `.git/hooks` directory.

6. **What are submodules in Git, and how are they used in complex projects?**
   - Submodules allow you to include one Git repository inside another as a subdirectory. They are used to manage dependencies or separate parts of a large project while keeping them in sync with external repositories.

7. **Explain how Git works in a distributed team environment. How do you ensure that no one's work is lost?**
   - In a distributed environment, each user has a full copy of the repository. To avoid losing work, teams use a combination of `git pull`, `git fetch`, and regular commits. Branches and pull requests are also used to manage collaboration.

8. **What is `git reflog`, and how is it useful in recovering lost commits?**
   - `git reflog` tracks all changes to the `HEAD` of your repository, even those that are not part of the current branch history. It is useful for recovering lost commits after a reset or rebase.

9. **How can you perform an interactive rebase, and what are the use cases?**
   - You can perform an interactive rebase using `git rebase -i <commit_hash>`. This allows you to edit, squash, or reorder commits, which is useful for cleaning up commit history before merging into the main branch.

10. **What are the best practices for writing good commit messages and maintaining a clean Git history?**
    - Use clear, concise commit messages, follow the "50/72" rule (50-character subject, 72-character body lines), and group related changes in a single commit. Regularly rebase feature branches to maintain a clean, linear history.
